# CongressChecklist
===================

List of things to do, to pack and tips on attending a congress, especially Chaos Communication Congress.

This list is irregularly updated (and pushed). You may want to refresh regularly. :-) Pull requests are welcome!

---


## Humans
General considerations to make the congress a worthwhile experience for everyone, humans, robots and aliens alike.
You'll also find a list of all the nice humans who have contributed to this list at the bottom.


### Manners
- Be excellent to each other.
- If you spot somebody not being excellent to someone else, remind them to be excellent and have them apologi(s|z)e to the insulted part(y|ies), but only if the insulted wish to be apologi(s|z)ed to. Sometimes the insulted party will just want to move on and not have any further contact with someone who was coarse to them.
- If you don't want to be called $swearword, don't behave like one.
- Help each other out.
- Read the “[Anti Harrassment Policy][3]” and live by it. :-)
- Ask if it is ok to take a picture BEFORE taking the picture.


## Things to do before traveling
- Charge ALL the batteries!
- Make backups.
- Bonus points for even testing restore
- Update all the software on your devices.
- You might want to empty your drives to make room for some COMPLETELY LEGAL media files that might be shared
- Put your name on your stuff, especially on things you’ll likely lend to someone (power strips, cables etc). Twitter handles make excellent name tags because people know how to contact you right away. Prefer permanent markers over stickers, for theft reasons.
- You DID make backups of all your devices, didn't you? That includes portable computers, servers, mobile phones, tablets, navigation devices, wrist watches and all your other $gadgets.
- Store the backups not only on the device your backing up or another device you’re taking with you. A swiss bank locker is good, if you have one.
- Send a pull request to this list for all the things I did not think of.
- Feed the guinea pigs.
- Water your plants.
- (optional but recommended) Create account in the [congress wiki][12], [add your projects][13] and [find your assembly][14].


## Things to send
Stuff that you're not allowed to bring on a plane or otherwise need to send via package courier or freight train. (Depending on its size.)


### Items that are explicitly forbidden to bring on a plane
- Ammunition
- Fireworks
- Explosives
- Lighter benzine
- Lighter gas (Butane)
- Matches
- Lighters (*only* allowed in hand luggage)
- Butane cartridges
- Propane cartridges
- Radioactive medication
- Toxics
- Lead acid batteries
- Mercury (Quecksilber)
- Acids
- Bleach
- Peroxides
- Samsung Galaxy Note 7


### Not allowed or often problematic on flights, or at least not in hand-lagguage
- Knives, even some pocket knives
- Lockpicking equipment
- Handcuffs


### Items *only* allowed to be carried *on your body*, but *neither* in checked in luggage nor hand-lagguage.
- Small lighters


## Things to pack

### Decoration
- Bring ridiculous amounts of LED strips and other photon emitting devices so we can illuminate ALL the things.

This applies to the Congress Center as well as your hotel windows.


### Documents
- Train/plane tickets (including verification documents for self-printed DB tickets. Check the List of accepted documents! [Was ist als Identifizierungskarte zugelassen?][41].)
- Congress tickets (printed or digital. iOS passbook/wallet, PDF)
- Passport or other kind of photo ID (Personalausweis)
- Driver's license (even an international one)
- Hotel booking
- Ham radio license (CEPT license)
- [Hackerspace passport][5]
- An [organ donor card][21] (We really hope you won't need them, but just in the case: you might save a life!)
- Your health insurance card
- Your vaccination documents or history (Impfpass)


### Payment stuff
When using ATMs/Cash Machines/Bankomaten/Geldautomaten give them a good wiggle before inserting your card. During 32C3 a Skimmer device had been found at an ATM at Bahnhof Dammtor. This is just a reminder, you should do that every time you use your card.

- Some cash (€uros, or other local currency)
- Credit card
- Maestro card (Bankomatkarte)
- Coins (€uros, for automated vending machines, like public transport tickets)
- Bitcoin wallet (the encrypted fashion with a good passphrase) or one for your preferred kind of crypo-currency
- Emergency numbers for your bank so you can lock your credit card/debit card/Bankomatkarte in case it gets lost/stolen/left behind.
    - German cards can be locked via the [lockinghotline][34] 116 116 (or +49 - 30 4050 4050)
    - For your Bankomat Karte (EC debit card) check if the “Geo Control” of your bank allows withdrawing in your destination country.


### Mobility
- Cards, PINs, Apps (and required account data) for Car- and bicycle sharing
- An app to show local public transport times. Not all cities are available in Google/Apple/You-name-it Maps applications.


#### Emergency Information for Events:
If you're in an emergency shout *HELP!*

If you need help, just call for help, there are many, many friendly people around to help you.

Event and location related emergency information is in a seperate document for the corresponding event in this repository! You may want to copy that info to a notes application on your smartphone or have a printed card in your wallet.

#### Personal medication
Your personal medication does not belong on the public interwebs for your privacy. This is just a reminder to pack it. Please do not include your personal medications in pull requests. :-)
If you need refrigeration for your personal medication, that is possible at the [C3 CERT][38]on site.
Pack some reserves of your medication. Better to have too much than not enough with you ;-)
Some meds require papers to be allowed legally in some countries, don't forget those to spare yourself unnecessary hassle by authorities. (e.g. medical uses of marihuana)

Come as you are, as a friend

- At least ONE clean shirt for each day you stay, plus two for traveling to and from congress (nerdy print is always welcome)
- At least ONE set of clean underwear for each day you stay, plus two for traveling to and from congress (Doesn't necessarily need to be in matching pairs, but that is up to you.)

### Gear
Label ALL your gear in a consistent manner. (Twitter handle and DECT numbers have proven to be working well.)
In case something gets lost it can find its way back to you.


#### Power and Chargers
Start charging your batteries right now so they're ready when you finish packing and leave.

For travelling abroad there is a handy [World Electrical Plug & Socket Map][40]


- Charger for laptop
	- Mac: small Duck-head and long ([Schuko Plug][6]) cord
	- Mac: MagSafe to MagSafe 2 Adapter
	- Mac: There are also cords that you can plug directly into the MagSafe charger (when removing the duck head) that end in a [Euro Plug][8]. These cables are also often used on electric shavers
    - Mac: USB-C type connector/charger
- Plug adaptor from your country of origin to [Schuko Plug][6]
- 3x to 10x multi-plug power extension (230V AC @50Hz) with [Schuko Plug][6] (and optional switch, hotel rooms usually suffer from severe lack of outlets)
- Simple extension cord (230V AC @50Hz, [Schuko Plug][6], the power outlet in your hotel room may be far away from your bedside)
- Chargers for all those phones, or at least matching cables if you can charge over USB.
	- iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPad, iPad 2, iPad 3 (The new iPad)
		- USB-A to 30 Pin dock connector (one each)
	- iPhone 5, iPhone 5S, iPhone 6, iPhone 6+, iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S+, iPhone SE, iPhone 7, iPhone 7+, iPad 4, iPad mini, iPad mini 2 with retina display, iPad mini 3, iPad mini 2, iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4, iPad Pro
		- USB-A to Lightning (one each)
	- most Android phones (and other exotic stuff like WP, Firefox OS, etc)
		- micro USB cable, or
        - USB-C cable (to USB A or USB-C)
    - DECT phones
        - Charging cradle (with power brick if required)
- Smart Watches
    - Charging cable or docking station required to charge
- A portable battery pack (aka powerbank) so you can charge on the go. (And the necessary cable to recharge that battery pack overnight. A USB-A to micro USB cable in most cases, maybe already a USB-C cable as well.)
- A spare plastic card to fool the power-saving system in your hotel room, while you're not there. (So your gear can charge and the LEDs keep blinking.)


#### Laptop and Devices
- Laptop (with a working battery)
        - Maybe clean display and keyboard while you're at it ;-)
- USB flash drives
	- Put an OWNER.txt file on them with information on how to contact you in case one gets lost accidentally. (Twitter, phone (for example DECT, 33C3 GSM extensions), email, name of the assembly you're well known at, owl, raven)
	- For devices with private information be sure to encrypt them! (VeraCrypt, GPG, FileVault, EncFS, Bitlocker, gbde, geli, dm-crypt, LUKS, eCryptFS)
        - Make a GPT Label or Volume label with your online nickname or handle because people can't read your owner.txt file on encrypted devices. You may also create multiple partitions (plaintext and encrypted ones).
	- make note of the filesystem used so you know if they will work on the system of the person you want to exchange data with. (FAT32 is a safe bet to work everywhere, for larger files ExFAT should also work on most platforms.)
	- Mac: NTFS can be read, but not written to without 3rd party software. FAT, ExFAT, HFS+(J), HFSX are fine for current OS X versions, ZFS, Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 and NTFS r/w support need 3rd party software. APFS support is experimental in macOS 10.12 Sierra and available from the command line only.
	- USB/Thunderbolt/USB-C to Ethernet RJ45 adapter, if your device needs one (for example thin notebooks)
- Mass storage devices (bring some empty ones to fill with data and/or bring your own data and share it!)
- Tablet computer, iPad, Android tablet, Microsoft surface
- Kindle
- An actual book (for those offline blackout moments), see [B.O.O.K.][32]


#### Wireless and HF
- SDR Equipment: HackRF, RTL-SDR, Ettus, [Rad1o badge][30]
- DVB-T dongle, there might be local DVB-T transmitter for the streams,
- Ham radio equipment, portable, the callsign prefix for CEPT licence holders in Germany is DL (Delta Lima), and DO (Delta Oscar) for CEPT-Novice licensees. Also see [ham radio licensing information for Germany][35]
    - Your ham radio license (Amateurfunklizenz)
- WiFi router/firewall (to connect to the hotel Wifi/network)


#### Cables and Adapters (Dongles)

- Have a sense of how the trains are going from the station near by, enter Dammtor here: http://geofox.de/jsf/stationSchedule.seam direct connections to the airport, enter Dammtor at start and Airport


## Securing your devices
All security measures for devices on public Internet networks also apply here – threats might come from untrusted devices _within_, as well as from maleficent third parties _outside_ the Congress network. Of course you should have these measures in place everywhere and all the time since event networks are no more or no less dangerous than the internet in general.

Read the [How to survive guide][1] in the Congress Wiki. There are many excellent tips in there or consult you local [CryptoParty][33] meetup, CCC ERFA or hackspace friends.


### Backups
Make fresh backups of ALL the devices you bring to CCCongress. Test that you can actually restore data from those backups!
Have something to backup your laptop on site as well.


### PowerOn/BIOS/EFI Password
Make sure you do have set a BIOS or EFI Password to prevent booting from a live CD to attack your system.


### Full disk encryption
Activate full disk encryption with pre-boot authentication. (Mac: Activate FileVault, FreeBSD: GELI, Linux: Cryptsetup, Windows: Windows? S'SLY?)

Make sure your system does suspend to disk (SSD) and not to RAM, so you can't extract the passphrase from RAM via Firewire/Thunderbolt/ColdBoot attack.


### Backups
You did make fresh backups of all your devices, did you?


### Servers
Check that _all_ your server services are using proper TLS. See [bettercrypto.org][15] or other sources you trust for help on how to properly configure your servers. (Mail, Web, VPN, SSH, etc.)


### VPN tunnel
Have at least one trusted, working and tested VPN endpoint available for tunneling out of the congress network. If you don't have your own VPN server at your disposal ask friends you trust to help you out. If you do, ask your friends if they need a VPN endpoint and share!  

- [OpenVPN][16]
- L2TP/IPSec/IKEv2
- [SSH][18]
- [SSHuttle][9]
- [iodine][17] (DNS tunnel for those pesky for-pay captive portal WiFi networks)
- [Tor/Vidalia][19]

Don't use PPTP, IKEv1, PSK VPNs anymore, they're known to be insecure.
Make sure your VPN works with IP and Legacy IP without leaking DNS and other traffic.

Also have those tunnels configured on ALL the devices you intend to use on the local network of the venue, and have it tested. That includes your laptops, phones, tablets, servers, fridge, etc.


### Phones
It is not recommended to connect your smartphone to the congress wifi, if you still can't resist, here are a few things to consider:

- Make sure that it's **not a 802.11b** device, as it would slow down the complete wifi network.
- Disable all synchronization services, as they might be using plaintext.
- Disable all auto-discovery services (network music players, remote control apps, etc …).
- Make sure there are no known exploits for your device (not that unknown-to-you exploits wouldn't be a possible risk as well…).
- Turn off push notifications.
- Update your apps, especially your browser.
- Use a VPN tunnel if possible.
- Use a Firewall and only allow the (few) services you trust.
	- [DroidWall][22] for Android (root required)
- If you don't have a VPN tunnel available, you can use [OnionBrowser][7] (iOS) or [Orbot][orbot] (Android) to surf via tor (which may be it's own kind of risk).
- Set your GSM network selection to **manual** or you might end up connected to a rogue GSM network by somebody.

**If you are unsure** that there might still be some services running and transmitting plaintext data, **do not connect**.


### PrePaid SIM Cards
Make sure you get a [right sized SIM card][11] for your GSM mobile phone!
If you need help with buying a SIM card, ask a local for assistance. They're friendly!

## Staying up-to-date
Most events publish a lot of information about events as they happen. There are many ways to stay in the loop during the event or in between by subscribing to RSS feeds, Twitter accounts, mailing lists and even newsletters [sic].
For a list of CCC related news sources you may be interested in following, see CCCongress.md in this repository.


## For when you return home
- store chocolate/chips/crisps at home as an post-event depression antidote
- Make notes during CCCongress to watch all the lectures you missed on site because you were attending an awesome workshop or were having interesting conversations with people.

# CongressChecklist
===================

List of things to do, to pack and tips on attending a congress, especially Chaos Communication Congress.

This list is irregularly updated (and pushed). You may want to refresh regularly. :-) Pull requests are welcome!

---


## Humans
General considerations to make the congress a worthwhile experience for everyone, humans, robots and aliens alike.
You'll also find a list of all the nice humans who have contributed to this list at the bottom.


### Manners
- Be excellent to each other.
- If you spot somebody not being excellent to someone else, remind them to be excellent and have them apologi(s|z)e to the insulted part(y|ies), but only if the insulted wish to be apologi(s|z)ed to. Sometimes the insulted party will just want to move on and not have any further contact with someone who was coarse to them.
- If you don't want to be called $swearword, don't behave like one.
- Help each other out.
- Read the “[Anti Harrassment Policy][3]” and live by it. :-)
- Ask if it is ok to take a picture BEFORE taking the picture.



## Things to do before traveling
- Charge ALL the batteries!
- Make backups.
- bonus points for even testing restore
- Update all the software on your devices.
- Put your name on your stuff, especially on things you’ll likely lend to someone (power strips, cables etc). Twitter handles make excellent name tags because people know how to contact you right away. Prefer permanent markers over stickers, for theft reasons.
- You DID make backups of all your devices, didn't you? That includes portable computers, servers, mobile phones, tablets, navigation devices, wrist watches and all your other $gadgets.
- Store the backups not only on the device your backing up or another device you’re taking with you. A swiss bank locker is good, if you have one.
- Send a pull request to this list for all the things I did not think of.
- Feed the guinea pigs.
- Water your plants.
- (optional) Create account in the [congress wiki][12], [add your projects][13] and [find your assembly][14].



## Things to pack

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvgN5gCuLac a copy of George Carlin's "stuff"

### Decoration
- Bring ridiculous amounts of LED strips so we can illuminate ALL the windows of the Radisson Hotel next to the CCH.
- If you have a lot of them, bring some more so we can also decorate all the other windows.

A normal window of a two-bed room is about 3.50m x 1.20m = 9.4m circumference.


### Documents
- train/plane tickets (including verification documents for self-printed DB tickets, like your credit card or Personalausweis)
- congress tickets (printed or in iOS passbook)
- passport or other kind of photo ID (Personalausweis)
- driver's license (even an international one)
- hotel booking
- ham radio license (CEPT license)
- [Hackerspace passport][5]
- an [organ donor card][21] (We really hope you won't need them, but just in the case: you might save a life!)
- your health insurance card


### Payment stuff
- some cash (€uros)
- credit card
- coins (€uros, for automated vending machines, like public transport tickets)
- Bitcoin wallet (the encrypted fashion with a good passphrase)
- emergency numbers for your bank so you can lock your credit card/debit card/Bankomatkarte in case it gets lost/stolen/left behind.


### Emergency information
In case of an accident or other emergency condition carry a piece of information whom to contact or any special medical information that might be viable to your survival/first aid/medical staff.

## Securing your devices
Read the [How to survive guide][1] in the Congress Wiki. There are many excellent tips in there.


### Backups
Make fresh backups of ALL the devices you bring to CCCongress. Test that you can actually restore data from those backups!


### BIOS/EFI Password
Make sure you do have set a BIOS or EFI Password to prevent booting from a live CD to attack your system.


### Full disk encryption
Activate full disk encryption with pre-boot authentication. (Mac: Activate FileVault.)


### Backups
You did make fresh backups of all your devices, did you?


### Servers
Check that _all_ your server services are using proper TLS. See [bettercrypto.org][15] for help on how to properly configure your servers. (Mail, Web, VPN, SSH, etc.)


### VPN tunnel
Have at least one trusted, working and tested VPN endpoint available for tunneling out of the congress network. If you don't have your own VPN server at your disposal ask friends you trust to help you out. If you do, ask your friends if they need a VPN endpoint and share!  

- [OpenVPN][16]
- L2TP/IPSec
- [SSH][18]
- [SSHuttle][9]
- [iodine][17] (DNS tunnel for those pesky for-pay captive portal WiFi networks)
- [Tor/Vidalia][19]

Also have those tunnels configured on ALL the devices you intend to use, and have it tested. That includes your laptops, phones, tablets, servers, fridge, etc.


### Phones
It is not recommended to connect your smartphone to the congress wifi, if you still can't resist, here are a few things to consider:

- Make sure that it's **not a 802.11b** device, as it would slow down the complete wifi network.
- Disable all synchronization services, as they might be using plaintext.
- Disable all auto-discovery services (network music players, remote control apps, etc …).
- Make sure there are no known exploits for your device (not that unknown-to-you exploits wouldn't be a possible risk as well…).
- Turn off push notifications.
- Update your apps, especially your browser.
- Use a VPN tunnel if possible.
- Use a Firewall and only allow the (few) services you trust.
	- [DroidWall][22] for Android (root required)
- If you don't have a VPN tunnel available, you can use [OnionBrowser][7] to surf via tor (which may be it's own kind of risk).
- Set your GSM network selection to **manual** or you might end up connected to a rogue GMS network by somebody.

**If you are unsure** that there might still be some services running and transmitting plaintext data, **do not connect**.

### PrePaid SIM Cards
Make sure you get a [right sized SIM card][11] for your GSM mobile phone!
If you need help with buying a SIM card, ask a local for assistance. They're friendly!

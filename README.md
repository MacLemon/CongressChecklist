# CongressChecklist
===================

List of things to do, to pack and tips on attending a congress, especially Chaos Communication Congress.

This list is irregularly updated (and pushed). You may want to refresh regularly. :-)

## Humans
General considerations to make the congress a worthwhile experience for everyone, humans, robots and aliens alike.
You'll also find list of all the nice humans who have contributed to this list at the bottom.


### Manners
- Be excellent to each other
- If you spot somebody not being excellent to someone else, remind them to be excellent and have them apologi(s|z)e to the insulted part(y|ies), but only if the insulted wish to be apologi(s|z)ed to. Sometimes the insulted party will just want to move on and not have any further contact with someone who was unexcellent to them.
- If you don't want to be called $swearword, don't behave like one.
- Help each other out
- Read the [Anti Harrassment Policy][3] and live by it :-)
- Ask if it is ok to take a picture BEFORE taking the picture.

## Securing your devices
Read the [How to survive guide][1] in the Congress Wiki. There are many excellent tips in there.


### Backups
Make fresh backups of ALL the devices you bring to CCCongress.


### BIOS/EFI Password
Make sure you do have set a BIOS or EFI Password to prevent booting from a live CD to attack your system.


### Full disk encryption
Activate full disk encryption with pre-boot authentication. (Mac: Activate FileVault.)


### Backups
You did make fresh backups of all your devices, did you?


### VPN tunnel
Have at least one trusted, working and tested VPN endpoint available for tunneling out of the congress network.  

- OpenVPN
- L2TP/IPSec
- SSH
- iodine (DNS tunnel for those pesky for-pay captive portal WiFi networks)
- Tor/Vidalia

Also have those tunnels configured on ALL the devices you intend to use, and have it tested. That includes your Laptops, phones, tablets, servers, fridge, etc.

### Phones
It is not recommended to connect your smartphone to the congress wifi, if you still can't resist, here are a few things to consider:

- make sure that it's **not a 802.11b** device, as it would slow down the complete wifi network.
- disable all synchronization services, as they might be using plaintext
- disable all auto-discovery services (network music players, remote control apps, etc...)
- make sure there are no known exploits for your device (not that unknown-to-you exploits wouldn't be a possible risk as well…)
- Turn off push notifications
- update your apps, especially your browser
- use a VPN tunnel if possible
- use a Firewall and only allow the (few) services you trust.
	- [DroidWall][20] for Android (root required)
- If you don't have a VPN tunnel available, you can use [OnionBrowser][7] to surf via tor (which may be it's own kind of risk)

**If you are unsure** that there might still be some services running and transmitting plaintext data, **do not connect**.
